# Tag Recommendation
Course project for ICS 624 at UH Manoa, Spring 2015

Twitter-based data collection

## Goal
* Recommend top n tags based on a searched tag

## Currently
* Hard-coded to #Ferguson
* This value can be changed in ``/lib/tasks/twitter_data_collection.rake``. In task ``get_twitter_data``, change variable ``tag`` from ``"#ferguson"`` to desired tag; I suggest you not delete the ``#``

## Notes
This project taught me to _never forget to write how to run the software in the readme_. When I remember how to do that, I'll add it here. (- DT, March 2017)
